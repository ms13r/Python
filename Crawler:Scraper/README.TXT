The following program crawls imgur and scrapes their user comments for their top
rated comments. Then, it prints either the top five comments that the user has posted,
or if there are less, the number of comments that they have. NOTE: Limited to the first
1000 pages of comments. The purpose was to become exposed and familiarized with JSON.

Program done individually.
